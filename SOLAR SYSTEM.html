 The Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars constitute the inner solar system, and the asteroid belt lies between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the outer solar system planets. The rotation of the planets causes the day and night, and the revolution of planets around the sun causes the change of seasons. Our solar system is present in the Milkyway galaxy. As per astronomers and scientists, the earth is the only planetary body that supports life.

<H1 ALIGN=left> The Sun</H1>

The Sun is a massive star at the center of our solar system. It is a huge ball of gases, primarily hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion to produce light and heat. This energy is essential for life on Earth, supporting various ecosystems, influencing weather patterns, and providing the warmth necessary for living beings to thrive.

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT> The Earth</H1>

The Earth is the third planet from the sun. It is also called the blue planeT. The Earth is the only planet that supports life because of the availability of air, water, and gases needed for survival. The climate of the Earth is mild. However, due to the overuse and wastage of resources, the planet is in danger, and global warming is increasing. This is affecting the survival conditions for human beings and all living things. In order to save our Earth, we will have to take major steps to conserve what is left on the planet because life is not possible on other planets.

<H1 ALIGN=LEFT> The Other Planets</H1>

Located at the centre of the solar system and influencing the motion of all the other bodies through its gravitational force is the Sun, which in itself contains more than 99 percent of the mass of the system. The planets, in order of their distance outward from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Four planets—Jupiter through Neptune—have ring systems, and all but Mercury and Venus have one or more moons.
